# Optimal Trajectory generation for Lane Changing in Frenet Frame

Learn from paper WerlingOptimalTrajectoryGenerationforDynamicStreetScenariosinaFrenetFrame

-     Planning the lane changing trajectory by combine the lateral and longitudinal cost function in frenet frame 
-     Simulated with the control algorithm to avoid collision from moving and static obstacles
